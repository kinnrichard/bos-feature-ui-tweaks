```

### **Test Organization and Naming Conventions:**
- **Unit Tests**: `*_test.rb` for individual service testing
- **Integration Tests**: `*_integration_test.rb` for cross-service testing
- **Performance Tests**: `*_performance_test.rb` for benchmarking
- **E2E Tests**: `*_e2e_test.rb` for complete workflow testing
- **Helper Classes**: `test_helper.rb` for shared testing utilities

### **Quality Gates and Validation:**
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run fast test subset before commits
- **Pull Request Gates**: Full test suite must pass before merge
- **Performance Regression Detection**: Automated performance comparison
- **Coverage Requirements**: >95% coverage required for new code
- **Code Quality Checks**: RuboCop and other static analysis tools

### **Testing Documentation and Maintenance:**
- **Test Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for each test phase
- **Test Maintenance**: Regular review and update of test scenarios
- **Performance Baseline Updates**: Regular updates to performance benchmarks
- **Test Data Management**: Systematic approach to test data maintenance
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team training on testing strategies and tools

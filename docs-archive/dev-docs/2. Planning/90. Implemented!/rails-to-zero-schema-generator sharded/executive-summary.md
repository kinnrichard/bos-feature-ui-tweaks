# Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture for an automated system that generates Zero schema definitions from Rails database schemas. The system addresses schema drift, reduces maintenance overhead, and ensures consistency between Rails models and Zero real-time synchronization.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Eliminates Manual Drift**: Automated generation prevents schema inconsistencies
- **Accelerates Development**: `rails zero:generate_schema` becomes part of standard workflow
- **Type Safety**: Generates consistent TypeScript interfaces for frontend
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth (Rails schema) drives Zero schema

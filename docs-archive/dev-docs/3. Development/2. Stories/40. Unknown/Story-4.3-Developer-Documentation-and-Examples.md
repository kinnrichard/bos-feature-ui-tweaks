# Story 4.3: Developer Documentation and Examples

**Epic:** Epic-005: Zero Mutation Autogeneration  
**Epic Goal:** Integration & Developer Experience

## User Story
As a developer,
I want comprehensive documentation and examples for the mutation generator,
so that I can quickly understand how to use it effectively and extend it for my specific needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Generated files include comprehensive JSDoc comments with usage examples for each mutation
2. Generator creates example custom files showing common extension patterns
3. Documentation includes clear examples of overriding generated functions with custom logic
4. README documentation covers installation, basic usage, and advanced configuration
5. Documentation includes troubleshooting guide for common errors and edge cases
6. Examples demonstrate integration with existing Zero client code and React components
7. Documentation covers best practices for organizing custom mutations and avoiding conflicts
8. Generated code includes TypeScript examples showing proper typing and error handling
9. Documentation includes migration guide for existing manual Zero mutations
10. Examples demonstrate testing strategies for both generated and custom mutations

## Technical Notes
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with usage examples
- Example custom files with common extension patterns
- Integration examples with Zero client and React
- Migration guide for existing manual mutations

## Security
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based authorization
- CSRF protection
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Encrypted passwords (bcrypt)

## Reliability
- **99.9% uptime target** - Monitored with external tools
- **Automated backups** - DigitalOcean Managed Postgres + B2 archival
- **Database transactions** - ACID compliance for data integrity
- **Graceful error handling** - User-friendly error messages
- **Data validation** - Input sanitization and business rule enforcement

## Quality Assurance Framework
- **Backend Testing**: Minitest for Rails API test coverage
- **Frontend Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end user journey testing
- **Integration Testing**: API endpoint testing with realistic data flows
- **Performance Monitoring**: Sentry for both Rails and Svelte error tracking
- **Database Backup Strategy**:
  - **Primary**: DigitalOcean Managed Postgres (automated daily backups, 35-day retention)
  - **Archival**: Daily pg_dump exports to Backblaze B2 (long-term storage)
  - **Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery with tested restore procedures
- **Deployment Safety**: Staging environment mirrors production for pre-release testing
- **User Feedback**: In-app feedback widget for real-time issue reporting

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Database indexing
- Caching strategy
- Background job processing
- CDN support (future)

## Integration
- **RESTful API design** - JSON responses for all endpoints
- **RMM/MDM Integration** - Native Addigy integration (developed separately)
- **Accounting Replacement** - Built-in general ledger and financial management
- **Payment Processing** - Plaid bank integration for automated transaction import
- **Email Notifications** - Customer communication (Phase 2)
- **Webhook Support** - Third-party integrations (future)

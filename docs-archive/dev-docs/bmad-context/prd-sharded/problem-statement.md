# Problem Statement

IT service providers struggle with:
- **Scattered Information** - Client details across emails, spreadsheets, and memory
- **Task Management** - No clear view of work status and assignments
- **Communication Gaps** - Technicians unaware of client history or preferences
- **Accountability Issues** - No audit trail of who did what and when
- **Manual Processes** - Time wasted on administrative tasks

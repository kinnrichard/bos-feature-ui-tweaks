# Story Management System

This directory contains all user stories organized by their current status. Stories represent smaller, focused features that can typically be completed in a single development iteration.

## Directory Structure

```
stories/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ in-progress/        # Currently being developed
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ story-*.md
â”œâ”€â”€ completed/          # Successfully delivered
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ story-*.md
â””â”€â”€ backlog/            # Planned for future
    â”œâ”€â”€ soon/           # High priority, next iteration
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ story-*.md
    â””â”€â”€ later/          # Lower priority, future iterations
        â””â”€â”€ story-*.md
```

## Story Lifecycle

### 1. Backlog â†’ In Progress
- Story is prioritized and assigned to developer
- All dependencies are satisfied
- Story is ready for implementation
- File moved from `backlog/` to `in-progress/`

### 2. In Progress â†’ Completed
- Story is fully implemented and tested
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Story is deployed to production
- File moved from `in-progress/` to `completed/`

- [Epics](../epics/README.md) - Larger features and initiatives

## Story Management Guidelines

### Creating New Stories

1. **Story Template**: Use the standard story template
2. **Clear Objectives**: Define clear, achievable objectives
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specify detailed acceptance criteria
4. **Size Appropriately**: Stories should be completable in 1-2 weeks
5. **Dependencies**: Identify and document dependencies
6. **Business Value**: Articulate clear business value

### Story Workflow

1. **Creation**: Create story in appropriate `backlog/` subdirectory
2. **Prioritization**: Review and prioritize in backlog
3. **Development**: Move to `in-progress/` when starting work
4. **Completion**: Move to `completed/` when delivered
5. **Documentation**: Update README files during transitions

### Story Documentation Standards

- **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, kebab-case filenames
- **Status Updates**: Keep story status current
- **Progress Tracking**: Use todo lists for task management
- **Cross-References**: Link to related stories and epics
- **Business Context**: Maintain business justification

## Migration Notes

This organized structure was created by consolidating stories from:
- `docs/stories/` (existing partial organization)
- `dev-docs/3. Development/2. Stories/` (legacy location)

All stories have been categorized by their actual completion status and moved to the appropriate directories.

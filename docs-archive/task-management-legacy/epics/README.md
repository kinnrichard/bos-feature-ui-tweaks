# Epic Management System

This directory contains all epics organized by their current status. Epics are large features or initiatives that span multiple user stories and require coordinated development effort.

## Directory Structure

```
epics/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This file
â”œâ”€â”€ active/             # Currently in progress
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ epic-*.md
â”œâ”€â”€ completed/          # Successfully delivered
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ epic-*.md
â””â”€â”€ backlog/            # Planned for future
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
    â””â”€â”€ epic-*.md
```

## Epic Lifecycle

### 1. Backlog â†’ Active
- Epic is prioritized and assigned to development team
- All dependencies are satisfied
- Epic is ready for implementation
- File moved from `backlog/` to `active/`

### 2. Active â†’ Completed
- Epic is fully implemented and tested
- All acceptance criteria are met
- Epic is deployed to production
- File moved from `active/` to `completed/`

## Epic Status Summary

### ðŸ”„ Active (1)
- [Epic-012: Secure Debug Architecture](./active/epic-012-secure-debug-architecture.md)

### âœ… Completed (13)
- **Zero.js Migration & Enhancement** (9 epics)
  - Epic-004 through Epic-011 (Zero.js system development)
- **Debug System & Architecture** (4 epics)
  - Epic-012 through Epic-015 (Debug system standardization)

### ðŸ“‹ Backlog (1)
- [Epic-016: Axios Interceptors](./backlog/Epic-016-Axios-Interceptors.md)

## Quick Navigation

- [Active Epics](./active/README.md) - Currently in progress
- [Completed Epics](./completed/README.md) - Successfully delivered
- [Backlog Epics](./backlog/README.md) - Planned for future development
- [Stories](../stories/README.md) - User stories and smaller features

## Epic Management Guidelines

### Creating New Epics

1. **Epic Template**: Use the standard epic template
2. **Clear Objectives**: Define clear, measurable objectives
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Specify detailed acceptance criteria
4. **Dependencies**: Identify and document dependencies
5. **Estimation**: Provide effort estimates
6. **Business Value**: Articulate clear business value

### Epic Workflow

1. **Creation**: Create epic in `backlog/` directory
2. **Prioritization**: Review and prioritize in backlog
3. **Development**: Move to `active/` when starting work
4. **Completion**: Move to `completed/` when delivered
5. **Documentation**: Update README files during transitions

### Epic Documentation Standards

- **Consistent Naming**: Use `epic-###-descriptive-name.md` format
- **Status Updates**: Keep epic status current
- **Progress Tracking**: Use todo lists for task management
- **Cross-References**: Link to related epics and stories
- **Business Context**: Maintain business justification

## Migration Notes

This organized structure was created by consolidating epics from:
- `dev-docs/3. Development/1. Epics/` (legacy location)
- Various scattered epic files throughout the repository

All epics have been categorized by their actual completion status and moved to the appropriate directories.

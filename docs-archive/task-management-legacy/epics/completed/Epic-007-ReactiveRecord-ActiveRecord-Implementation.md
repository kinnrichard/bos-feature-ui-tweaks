# Epic 007: ReactiveRecord + ActiveRecord Architecture Implementation

**Epic ID**: EPIC-007  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Created**: July 2025  
**Team**: Frontend Architecture  

---

## 🎯 Epic Overview

### Problem Statement

Current Zero.js integration uses `ReactiveQuery` and `ReactiveQueryOne` classes that:
- **Violate DRY principles** with 80% code duplication between classes
- **Break Rails conventions** with non-standard API patterns
- **Cause developer confusion** about which class to use when
- **Have poor performance** due to Object.assign overhead and proxy patterns
- **Require manual maintenance** of TypeScript model files

### Epic Goal

Replace the current reactive query system with a Rails-compatible dual-class architecture that provides:
- **Perfect Rails ActiveRecord API compatibility** (`find`, `find_by`, `where`, scopes)
- **Context-optimized performance** (ReactiveRecord for Svelte, ActiveRecord for vanilla JS)
- **Zero code duplication** through factory pattern and shared configuration
- **Automated generation** from Rails models with zero manual maintenance

### Business Value

- **Developer Productivity**: 25% faster component development with Rails-familiar API
- **Code Quality**: 80% reduction in model-related code duplication
- **Performance**: Optimal speed for both Svelte components and vanilla JavaScript
- **Maintainability**: Zero manual edits to generated files, Rails-driven source of truth
- **Team Velocity**: Immediate productivity for Rails developers, no learning curve

### Success Criteria

- [ ] 100% Rails ActiveRecord API compatibility verified
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved during migration
- [ ] Clear naming: `ReactiveJob` for Svelte, `ActiveJob` for vanilla JS
- [ ] Zero manual edits required to generated TypeScript files
- [ ] Performance meets benchmarks: ActiveRecord within 2x of direct object access
- [ ] Rails generator automatically maintains TypeScript model sync

## Backlog Management

When managing backlog epics:

1. **Prioritization**: Review and prioritize epics based on business value
2. **Estimation**: Ensure epics have proper effort estimates
3. **Dependencies**: Identify and document epic dependencies
4. **Readiness**: Verify epics are ready for development before moving to active
5. **Regular Review**: Conduct regular backlog grooming sessions

## Moving to Active

To move an epic from backlog to active:

1. Ensure epic is fully defined with clear acceptance criteria
2. Verify dependencies are satisfied
3. Assign development team
4. Move file from `backlog/` to `active/`
5. Update epic status to "In Progress"
6. Update README files in both directories

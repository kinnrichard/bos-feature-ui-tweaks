# New Developer Getting Started Guide

> **Welcome to the b≈ès project! This guide will take you from zero to productive contributor.**

## üéØ Objectives
After completing this guide, you will:
- Have a fully functional development environment
- Understand the project architecture and codebase
- Have made your first successful contribution
- Know how to navigate the development workflow

## üìã Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript
- Familiarity with Git version control
- Understanding of web development concepts
- Development machine with admin access

## üìö Quick Context

**b≈ès** is a client/job/task management system for IT company technicians. The system tracks:
- **Clients** - Companies being served
- **Jobs** - Work orders and projects
- **Tasks** - Individual work items
- **Devices** - IT equipment per client
- **People** - Client contacts and personnel

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rails 8.0.2 + Ruby 3.4.4 + PostgreSQL
- **Testing**: Playwright (frontend) + Rails Minitest (backend)
- **Deployment**: Kamal + Docker

### 2.2 Key Architecture Concepts

#### Frontend Architecture
- **SvelteKit**: Full-stack framework with file-based routing
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript with excellent tooling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Reactive State**: Svelte stores for global state management

#### Backend Architecture
- **Rails API**: JSON-only API following REST conventions
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with UUID primary keys
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication system
- **Service Objects**: Business logic encapsulation

#### Data Flow
```
Frontend (SvelteKit) ‚Üí API (Rails) ‚Üí Database (PostgreSQL)
```

### 2.3 Core Business Models

#### Client
- Represents companies or organizations served
- Has many jobs, devices, and people
- Tracks billing information and contact details

#### Job
- Work orders or projects for clients
- Has many tasks and can have assigned technicians
- Tracks priority, status, and due dates

#### Task
- Individual work items within jobs
- Can be hierarchical (parent/child relationships)
- Supports drag-and-drop reordering

#### Device
- IT equipment associated with clients
- Tracks hardware details and maintenance history

#### Person
- Contacts and personnel at client organizations
- Can have multiple contact methods (email, phone, etc.)

### 2.4 Essential Reading
1. **[Frontend Architecture](../architecture/frontend-architecture.md)** - Svelte patterns
2. **[Backend Architecture](../architecture/backend-architecture.md)** - Rails API patterns
3. **[Database Schema](../architecture/database-schema.md)** - Data relationships
4. **[API Specification](../api/api-specification.md)** - Endpoint documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 3: Development Workflow (45-60 minutes)

### 3.1 Git Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make changes...

# Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes ‚ÄîCC"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create pull request via GitHub
```

### 3.2 Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Frontend type checking and linting
cd frontend
npm run check      # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint       # ESLint code quality
npm run format     # Prettier code formatting

# Backend code quality
cd ..
rubocop -A         # Ruby code style fixes
```

### 3.3 Testing Workflow
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test       # Frontend Playwright tests
rails test         # Backend Rails tests

# Run specific test categories
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests only
npm run test:e2e         # End-to-end tests only

# Run tests with browser visible (debugging)
npm run test:headed
```

### 3.4 Development Servers
```bash
# Start all development servers
rails server -b 0.0.0.0 > /dev/null 2>&1 &  # Backend API
cd frontend && npm run dev                    # Frontend dev server

# Access points:
# - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
```

## üéØ Phase 4: First Contribution (60-90 minutes)

### 4.1 Choose a Starter Task
Good first contribution options:
- **Fix a typo or improve documentation**
- **Add a small UI improvement**
- **Write additional tests for existing functionality**
- **Fix a minor bug from the issue tracker**

### 4.2 Make Your First Change

#### Example: Add a New Button to Job Detail Page

1. **Locate the relevant files:**
   ```bash
   # Frontend job detail page
   frontend/src/routes/jobs/[id]/+page.svelte
   
   # Backend job controller
   app/controllers/api/v1/jobs_controller.rb
   ```

2. **Make the change:**
   ```svelte
   <!-- Add to job detail page -->
   <button class="btn btn-primary" on:click={handleExampleAction}>
     Example Action
   </button>
   ```

3. **Add corresponding functionality:**
   ```javascript
   function handleExampleAction() {
     console.log('Example action triggered');
     // Add your functionality here
   }
   ```

4. **Write a test:**
   ```javascript
   // frontend/tests/jobs/example-action.spec.ts
   import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
   
   test('example action button works', async ({ page }) => {
     await page.goto('/jobs/1');
     await page.click('button:text("Example Action")');
     // Add assertions
   });
   ```

### 4.3 Test Your Changes
```bash
# Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
npm test

# Check code quality
npm run check && npm run lint

# Start dev server and manually test
npm run dev
```

### 4.4 Submit Your Change
```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add example action button to job detail page ‚ÄîCC"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/add-example-action
```

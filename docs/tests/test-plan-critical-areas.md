## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Business Logic (Week 1)
1. TaskSortingService - Complete unit test suite
2. Task model - Validations and state transitions
3. Job model - State machine and validations

### Phase 2: Data Integrity (Week 2)
1. ActivityLog - Tracking and querying
2. Authorization - Security testing
3. Client uniqueness - Data validation

### Phase 3: Complex Features (Week 3)
1. Task reordering endpoints
2. ScheduledDateTime validation
3. Performance testing for N+1 queries

## Test Data Factories

Create factories for consistent test data:

```ruby
# test/factories/jobs.rb
FactoryBot.define do
  factory :job do
    association :client
    association :created_by, factory: :user
    title { "Fix Server Issue" }
    status { 0 } # open
    priority { 2 } # normal
    
    trait :with_tasks do
      after(:create) do |job|
        create_list(:task, 3, job: job)
      end
    end
    
    trait :in_progress do
      status { 1 }
    end
    
    trait :completed do
      status { 5 }
      completed_at { Time.current }
    end
  end
end
```

## Test Helpers

Create shared test helpers:

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
class ActiveSupport::TestCase
  # Helper to sign in user for integration tests
  def sign_in_as(user)
    post login_path, params: { 
      email: user.email, 
      password: 'password' 
    }
  end
  
  # Helper to assert activity was logged
  def assert_activity_logged(action, resource)
    log = ActivityLog.last
    assert_equal action, log.action
    assert_equal resource, log.loggable
  end
  
  # Helper to create job with standard setup
  def create_job_with_tasks(task_count: 3)
    job = create(:job, :with_tasks)
    job.tasks.each_with_index do |task, index|
      task.update!(position: (index + 1) * 10)
    end
    job
  end
end
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All P0 tests passing
- [ ] All P1 tests passing  
- [ ] No reduction in existing test coverage
- [ ] Tests run in < 30 seconds
- [ ] Clear test failure messages
- [ ] No flaky tests

## Excluded from Current Plan

These areas will be tested after major changes are complete:

- UI component rendering tests
- Detailed controller response format tests
- View-specific behavior tests
- CSS/styling tests
- JavaScript unit tests (Stimulus controllers)
- Full end-to-end workflows (covered by Playwright)

## Monitoring Test Health

1. **Run tests before each commit**
   ```bash
   rails test:models
   rails test:services  
   rails test:integration
   ```

2. **Monitor test performance**
   ```bash
   rails test --profile
   ```

3. **Check for test interdependencies**
   ```bash
   rails test --random
   ```

4. **Measure coverage (optional)**
   ```bash
   # Add simplecov gem
   rails test
   open coverage/index.html
   ```

This plan provides comprehensive coverage of critical business logic while maintaining flexibility for upcoming changes.

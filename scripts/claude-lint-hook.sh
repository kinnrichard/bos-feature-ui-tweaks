Claude Code Linting Hook

Usage:
  claude-lint-hook.sh <file>           # Check mode (blocks Claude on errors)
  claude-lint-hook.sh --auto-fix <file> # Auto-fix mode (attempts to fix errors)

Environment Variables:
  LINT_CONTEXT=claude (automatically set)
  LINT_MODE=check|fix (set based on mode)

Integration:
  This script is designed to be called by Claude Code hooks.
  It will block Claude's workflow until linting passes.

Examples:
  claude-lint-hook.sh app/models/user.rb
  claude-lint-hook.sh --auto-fix frontend/src/app.ts

# Drag-Drop Implementation Roadmap

> **Project**: Drag-Drop Boundary Implementation  
> **Timeline**: 3 weeks (July 25 - August 15, 2025)  
> **Status**: Planning Phase  

## Executive Summary

- [ ] Collapsed children scenarios
- [ ] Invalid operation prevention
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

**Success Criteria**:
- All edge cases handled gracefully
- Clear error messages for invalid operations
- Robust fallback mechanisms

## Phase 3: Validation (Week 3)

### Day 11-12: Regression Testing
**Owner**: QA Team
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Full regression test suite execution
- [ ] Performance validation across scenarios
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Real-time sync validation

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero regressions identified
- Performance benchmarks met
- All browsers supported

### Day 13-14: User Acceptance Testing
**Owner**: Product Team + QA
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] User testing sessions conducted
- [ ] Feedback collection and analysis
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements
- [ ] Final validation testing

**Success Criteria**:
- Users validate intuitive behavior
- No "bizarre results" reported
- High user satisfaction scores

### Day 15: Production Deployment
**Owner**: Engineering + Ops
**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Feature flag configuration
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested

**Success Criteria**:
- Successful production deployment
- Monitoring shows healthy metrics
- User adoption successful

## Risk Timeline

### Week 1 Risks
- **Complex logic replacement**: Mitigate with thorough code review
- **Performance regression**: Mitigate with continuous benchmarking

### Week 2 Risks  
- **Edge case discovery**: Mitigate with comprehensive test scenarios
- **Integration issues**: Mitigate with incremental testing

### Week 3 Risks
- **User acceptance concerns**: Mitigate with early feedback loops
- **Production deployment issues**: Mitigate with rollback procedures

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Daily Metrics
- Test pass rate
- Performance benchmark results
- Code coverage percentage
- Bug discovery and resolution rate

### Weekly Milestones
- **Week 1**: Core functionality operational
- **Week 2**: Comprehensive testing complete  
- **Week 3**: Production ready and deployed

### Final Success Criteria
- Zero "bizarre results" in production
- Performance targets met (<100ms)
- User satisfaction scores >90%
- Technical debt minimized

## Communication Plan

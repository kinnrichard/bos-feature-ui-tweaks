# Epic: Migrate existing task management system to AI TrackDown

## Overview
This epic tracks the migration of the existing task management system from `docs/epics/` and `docs/stories/` to the AI TrackDown system. The b≈ès project currently has approximately 15 completed epics and 30+ stories that need to be migrated or archived appropriately.

## Objectives
- [x] Clean up auto-generated AI TrackDown setup tasks
- [x] Migrate active epic (epic-012-secure-debug-architecture)
- [x] Migrate backlog epics (Epic-016, Epic-017)
- [x] Migrate in-progress stories to AI TrackDown issues
- [x] Archive completed epics and stories for reference
- [x] Update project documentation to reference AI TrackDown
- [x] Train team on new AI TrackDown system

## Success Criteria
- All active work items are tracked in AI TrackDown
- Historical data is preserved in an archive
- Team documentation is updated
- No loss of important task information
- Clear mapping between old and new task IDs

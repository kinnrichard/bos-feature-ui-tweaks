# Epic: Implement Axios Interceptors for Seamless Token Management

## Overview
Currently, users experience authentication interruptions when tokens expire during active work sessions. This epic implements axios interceptors to provide seamless token refresh, eliminating authentication disruptions and improving user experience.

## Business Value

**Key Benefits:**
- **Eliminate auth interruptions** - Users never lose work due to token expiry
- **Improve productivity** - Seamless background token refresh
- **Reduce support burden** - Fewer authentication-related issues
- **Enhance security** - Proper token lifecycle management
- **Better developer experience** - DRY authentication logic

## Current State Analysis

### Problems with Current Approach:
1. **Manual token management** - Each request requires manual CSRF token handling
2. **No automatic refresh** - 401 errors cause immediate redirect to login
3. **No request queueing** - Concurrent requests during refresh fail
4. **Repetitive logic** - Token handling duplicated across methods
5. **Poor user experience** - Users lose work when tokens expire

### Existing Architecture:
- ✅ **Sophisticated CsrfTokenManager** with proactive refresh
- ✅ **Request queueing** for concurrent token requests
- ✅ **Multiple token sources** (meta tag, API)
- ✅ **4-minute cache duration** with 2-minute refresh threshold
- ❌ **No automatic refresh** - relies on manual redirect
- ❌ **No request retry** - failed requests are not retried

## Objectives
- [x] Phase 1: Install axios and create EnhancedApiClient class
- [x] Phase 2: Implement request interceptor with automatic CSRF token injection
- [x] Phase 3: Implement response interceptor with auth error handling
- [x] Phase 4: Implement request queue management for concurrent requests
- [x] Phase 5: Implement error handling strategies (CSRF, rate limiting, server errors)
- [x] Phase 6: Integrate with existing ApiClient and Zero.js
- [x] Phase 7: Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- [x] Phase 8: Direct deployment with monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics:
- **Zero authentication interruptions** during user sessions
- **100% transparent token refresh** - no user awareness required
- **<500ms token refresh time** - minimal performance impact
- **99%+ token refresh success rate** - reliable operation
- **80% code reduction** in authentication logic

### User Experience Metrics:
- **Zero lost work incidents** due to token expiry
- **95% reduction** in authentication error reports
- **Improved user satisfaction** - seamless app experience
- **Reduced support tickets** - fewer auth-related issues
- **Better productivity** - uninterrupted workflow

## Technical Architecture

### Enhanced API Client Structure:
- Axios instance with custom interceptors
- Request interceptor for automatic CSRF token injection
- Response interceptor for auth error handling
- Request queue management during token refresh
- Comprehensive error handling strategies
- Integration with existing CsrfTokenManager
- Coordination with Zero.js real-time connection

### Security Considerations:
- Tokens never stored in localStorage
- Automatic token rotation
- Secure cookie transmission
- CSRF protection maintained
- Request signature validation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup (Week 1)
- Install axios dependency
- Create EnhancedApiClient class
- Implement basic interceptors
- Unit tests for core functionality

### Phase 2: Feature Complete (Week 2)
- Request/response interceptor implementation
- Request queue management
- Error handling strategies
- Integration tests

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Week 3)
- Zero.js integration
- Migration from existing ApiClient
- End-to-end testing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 4)
- Direct production deployment
- Monitoring and metrics setup
- Production validation
- Performance monitoring

## Related Issues
(To be created for each implementation phase)

## Notes
- Builds on existing CsrfTokenManager architecture
- Maintains backward compatibility during migration
- Direct deployment approach for greenfield project
- Comprehensive monitoring for production validation

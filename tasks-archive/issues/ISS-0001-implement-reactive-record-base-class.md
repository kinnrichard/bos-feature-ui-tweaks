# Issue: Implement ReactiveRecord Base Class

## Description
**As a** frontend developer using Svelte components,
**I want** a ReactiveRecord base class that provides Rails-like reactive queries,
**So that** I can use familiar Rails patterns while getting automatic UI updates when data changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **ReactiveRecord Base Class Implementation**
   - Create `frontend/src/lib/models/base/reactive-record.ts` following specification
   - Provide identical API to ActiveRecord but return ReactiveQuery objects instead of Promises
   - Support all Rails-style methods: `find()`, `where()`, `all()`, `kept()`, `discarded()`, `withDiscarded()`
   - Integrate with Svelte 5 runes for reactive state management

2. **ReactiveQuery Integration**
   - ReactiveRecord methods return ReactiveQuery<T> objects compatible with existing ReactiveQuery implementation
   - Support method chaining with reactive scoped queries
   - Maintain 5-minute TTL caching as per current ReactiveTask implementation
   - Provide `.data`, `.isLoading`, `.error` reactive properties

3. **Type Safety and Rails Compatibility**
   - Full TypeScript support with proper generics `ReactiveRecord<T extends BaseRecord>`
   - Type-safe query building without `as any` casts
   - Follow exact same method signatures as ActiveRecord for API consistency
   - Support Rails discard gem patterns reactively

4. **Integration with Zero.js**
   - Seamless integration with existing Zero.js client (`getZero()`)
   - Proper error handling matching ActiveRecord patterns
   - Support for Zero.js query building and materialization
   - Maintain existing Zero.js reactive view lifecycle management

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with Svelte usage examples
   - Clear import patterns for reactive vs non-reactive contexts
   - Usage examples showing Svelte 5 integration patterns

## Tasks
(To be created as separate task items)

## Dependencies
- Existing ReactiveQuery implementation
- Zero.js client integration
- Svelte 5 runes system

## Notes
- This is part of the ReactiveRecord architecture simplification
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing code
- Performance considerations for reactive updates

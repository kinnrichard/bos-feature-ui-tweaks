# Manual Test Results - New Task Text Glitch Fix

## Test Date: 2025-07-23
## Fix Applied: Moved `taskCreationManager.hide()` to beginning of createTask function

### Test 1: Normal Task Creation ✓
- Opened http://localhost:5173/jobs/test
- Clicked "New Task" button
- Typed "Test task without glitch"
- Pressed Enter
- **Result**: Task created, input cleared immediately, NO text appeared in bottom New Task row

### Test 2: Rapid Task Creation ✓
- Created 5 tasks in quick succession:
  - "Quick task 1" → Enter
  - "Quick task 2" → Enter  
  - "Quick task 3" → Enter
  - "Quick task 4" → Enter
  - "Quick task 5" → Enter
- **Result**: All tasks created smoothly, no visual glitches observed

### Test 3: Long Text ✓
- Created task with long text: "This is a very long task name to test if the glitch appears with longer text content that might take more time to process"
- **Result**: Input cleared immediately, no ghosting

### Test 4: Error Recovery (Simulated)
- Would need to disconnect network or mock API failure
- Code inspection shows error recovery is implemented:
  ```javascript
  taskCreationManager.show(type);
  taskCreationManager.setTitle(type, title);
  ```

### Test 5: Blur Event ✓
- Typed "Test blur event"
- Clicked outside the input instead of pressing Enter
- **Result**: Task created, input cleared properly

## Summary
✅ The fix successfully eliminates the visual glitch
✅ Input clears immediately upon submission
✅ No text ghosting in the New Task row
✅ Error recovery code is in place
✅ All existing functionality preserved

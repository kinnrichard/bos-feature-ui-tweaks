# Epic: Redesign New Contact Page with Chromeless UI

## Overview
Redesign the New Contact page to create a clean, centered layout with chromeless input fields that match the design pattern used in the Job view's EditableTitle component. The goal is to create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface that focuses user attention on the essential information.

## Design Requirements

### Layout Structure
- **Centered Card Design**: Create a centered layout with appropriate max-width
- **Person Icon**: Display the existing `/icons/person.circle.fill.svg` at 64x64px at the top center
- **Stacked Fields**: Name and Title fields positioned directly below the icon in a centered layout
- **No Chrome/Borders**: Remove all section containers and borders for a clean appearance

### Input Field Design
- **Chromeless Inputs**: Implement the same chromeless design pattern as EditableTitle
  - No visible borders in default state
  - Subtle focus ring using `focus-ring-tight` mixin (inset shadow)
  - Background color change on focus similar to EditableTitle
  - Proper padding to prevent layout shift when focus ring appears
- **Consistent Styling**: Match the focus behavior and visual feedback of the Job title editing

### Contact Methods Enhancement
- **Keep Dynamic List**: Maintain the existing dynamic contact methods functionality
- **Two Default Fields**: Start with two contact method fields instead of one
- **Differentiated Placeholders**: 
  - First field: "Email or phone"
  - Second field: "Address or other contact method"
- **Make It Inviting**: The different placeholders should guide users to add diverse contact information

### Fields to Hide (For Now)
- Remove "Preferred Name" field from the initial view
- Remove "Pronunciation" field from the initial view
- These will be addressed in a future redesign phase

## Technical Implementation

### Component Updates
1. **Create ChromelessInput Component** (or extend FormInput)
   - Based on EditableTitle's focus ring implementation
   - Use `focus-ring-tight` mixin for inset shadow effect
   - Include padding strategy to prevent layout shift
   - Support for placeholder text

2. **Update Page Structure**
   - Remove section containers ("Basic Information", "Contact Methods")
   - Implement centered card layout
   - Add person icon at top
   - Stack fields vertically with appropriate spacing

3. **Styling Approach**
   - Use existing CSS variables from the design system
   - Implement focus states matching EditableTitle:
     ```scss
     padding: 3px 8px;
     margin: -3px -8px;
     
     &:focus {
       background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
       border-radius: 4px;
       // focus-ring-tight mixin applies inset shadow
     }
     ```

## Success Criteria
- [x] Page has a clean, centered layout with no visible containers or borders
- [x] Input fields use chromeless design with focus rings matching EditableTitle
- [x] Person icon is prominently displayed at top center
- [x] Contact methods start with two fields with inviting, differentiated placeholders
- [x] Focus behavior provides clear visual feedback without layout shifts
- [x] Mobile responsive design maintains the clean aesthetic
- [x] Accessibility is preserved with proper focus indicators and ARIA labels

## User Stories

### Story 1: Clean Visual Hierarchy
**As a** user creating a new contact  
**I want** a clean, uncluttered interface  
**So that** I can focus on entering the essential information without distraction

### Story 2: Intuitive Contact Methods
**As a** user adding contact information  
**I want** clear placeholder guidance in the contact fields  
**So that** I understand what types of information I can add

### Story 3: Smooth Interaction
**As a** user entering information  
**I want** subtle visual feedback when I interact with fields  
**So that** I know which field is active without jarring visual changes

## Dependencies
- EditableTitle component (reference implementation)
- Existing focus-ring mixins and styles
- Person icon asset (`/icons/person.circle.fill.svg`)

## Future Considerations
- Phase 2: Address pronunciation and preferred name fields
- Consider adding progressive disclosure for advanced fields
- Evaluate if this chromeless pattern should extend to other forms

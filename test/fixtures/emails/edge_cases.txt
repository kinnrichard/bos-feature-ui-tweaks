## 2. Email with No Clear Quote Markers
This is a reply to your message about the project status. I think the approach you suggested makes sense and we should proceed with the implementation as planned. The timeline looks reasonable and the technical requirements are clear.

John mentioned that he would handle the backend integration while Sarah focuses on the frontend components. This division of work should help us meet the deadline.

Let me know if you need any clarification on the requirements.

## 3. Email with Nested Quotes

## 4. Email with HTML-like Content in Plain Text
The <script> tag should be handled carefully.

Here's the code snippet:
<div class="container">
  <p>Hello World</p>
</div>

This is not actual HTML, just text that looks like HTML.

## 10. Email with Embedded Lists and Formatting
Here are my thoughts on the proposal:

1. Architecture looks solid
2. Implementation timeline is reasonable  
3. Testing strategy needs more detail

Action items:
• Review security implications
• Update documentation
• Schedule code review

Let's discuss in tomorrow's meeting.

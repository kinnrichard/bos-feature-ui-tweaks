Excellent implementation! I'm particularly impressed with the error handling and retry mechanisms.

A few technical observations:
- The polymorphic association design is elegant
- Batch processing performance metrics are very useful
- PyCall integration handles edge cases well

Questions for the team:
1. How should we handle multilingual emails?
2. What's our strategy for handling very large attachments?
3. Should we implement custom parsing rules for specific clients?

I'll coordinate the security review next.

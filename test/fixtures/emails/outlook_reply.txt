Perfect! The implementation looks solid. I particularly like the batch processing approach.

A couple of follow-up items:
- Can we add metrics dashboard integration?
- Should we implement rate limiting for the parsing queue?

I'll schedule a demo for the stakeholders next week.

Subject: Email Parser Implementation Complete

Hi Team,

I'm excited to announce that the email parsing implementation is now complete and ready for testing.

Technical highlights:
• Talon library integration for accurate reply extraction
• Polymorphic database design for flexibility
• Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
• Performance optimizations for large-scale processing

Next steps:
1. QA testing phase
2. Performance benchmarking
3. Documentation updates
4. Production deployment planning

Please review the implementation and let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
John Doe
